## Project Description

Movie Explorer is designed for users who are either looking for a movie to watch or already have a title in mind but donâ€™t know where it's available to stream. The app lets users search by movie title or filter results based on genre and streaming platform. This way, users can either discover new movies that match their preferences or check where a specific movie can be streamed. The goal is to provide both discovery and convenience by showing available streaming options for each movie.

The project was initiated inspired by the growing number of streaming platforms available today and the fact that many users have multiple subscriptions, yet still struggle to find the movie they want to watch. Often, a movie is only available on a specific platform, or users receive a recommendation and want to watch it, but first need to search across different services to check availability. This process can be frustrating, sometimes leading users to lose interest altogether.

Our Streamlit-based web application solves the problem by tackling two core user needs; first, it helps users who are searching for a movie to watch, either by title or by filtering based on genre, while considering the availability across streaming platforms; second, it supports users who already have a specific movie in mind but are unsure which platform offers it for streaming.

Moreover, our project uses real-time data from reliable sources like IMDb and Watchmode, ensuring users always receive updated information about movies and their streaming availability. This eliminates the risk of outdated results, so whenever a new movie is added or updated on IMDb, users will instantly have access to the latest information.

Ultimately, the main goal of our solution is to reduce user frustration, save time, and enhance the movie-watching experience by combining discovery and availability into one streamlined, user-friendly platform.
